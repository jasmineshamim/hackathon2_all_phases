# Data Model: Todo Full-Stack Web Application

## Entities

### User
Represents a registered user with authentication credentials, uniquely identified by user ID.

**Fields:**
- `id`: string (primary key, auto-generated by Better Auth)
- `email`: string (unique, required, valid email format)
- `name`: string (optional, up to 100 characters)
- `created_at`: datetime (auto-generated)
- `updated_at`: datetime (auto-generated, updated on changes)

**Validation:**
- Email must be unique across all users
- Email must follow standard email format
- Name is optional but if provided must be 1-100 characters

### Task
Represents a todo item with title, description, completion status, and association to a specific user.

**Fields:**
- `id`: integer (primary key, auto-increment)
- `user_id`: string (foreign key to User.id, indexed)
- `title`: string (required, 1-200 characters)
- `description`: string (optional, up to 1000 characters)
- `completed`: boolean (default: false)
- `created_at`: datetime (auto-generated)
- `updated_at`: datetime (auto-generated, updated on changes)

**Validation:**
- Title must be 1-200 characters
- Description is optional but if provided must be 1-1000 characters
- user_id must reference an existing user
- A task can only be accessed by its owner (user_id)

## Relationships
- User (1) → Task (Many): A user can have many tasks
- Task (Many) → User (1): Each task belongs to one user

## State Transitions
- Task status can transition from `pending` (completed: false) to `completed` (completed: true)
- Task status can transition from `completed` (completed: true) back to `pending` (completed: false)

## Constraints
- Users can only access/modify their own tasks (enforced by API layer and database)
- Tasks must have a valid user_id that exists in the User table
- Task titles must not be empty
